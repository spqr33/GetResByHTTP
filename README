General purpose of the program is a getting resources by HTTP Protocol.
Program has NOT any warranties, and you can/should/must/may use it AS IS.

Usage:
./getResByHTTP	    simultaneous_downloads	 /path/to/taskFile

It is possible to download at the same time up to 
simultaneous_downloads resources.

You need to provide also a task File, this one must have the following structure:
URL  localFileName
You can use comment lines followed by #.
  

The program downloads resources only if server answers with 200 status and the
answer has a Content-Length header.
Otherwise the program reports about an inability of download this resource.

You can build also Release or Debug version(Release is default).
Change DEFAULTCONF=Release line to DEFAULTCONF=Debug in makefile.
Debug version is bigger, but provides additional info.
There is clean target in makefile. You can use it to clean the current
configuration build directory.
